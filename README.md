# Exploring Density Profiles of Dark Matter Haloes

## Abstract

One of the most well-known indicators for the existence of dark matter is in the rotational velocity curves of galaxies. While with only baryonic matter we expect the gravitational acceleration to be proportional to $r^{-2}$ at large distances $r$, implying the rotational velocity to follow a $r^{-1/2}$ relationship, our observations show that the rotational velocity profile in fact flattens out at large radii. This indicates the existence of a non-baryonic type of mass contributing to the structure of galaxies. In this work, I experiment with two different galaxy density profile models, integrating them using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm (RK4) to acquire the rotational velocity curves from these models. I find that RK4 is decently effective in accurately computing the rotational curve from these simple density profiles, and is a great tool for simulating and studying halo models.
